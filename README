# Restaurant App

This project is part of my first-year student development program, where I've learned PHP and POO. It is a small application designed to manage and export data, serving as a back-office for a small website.

## Features

- Manage groups with categories and items (in order to create product pages).
- Utilize the media section (slider table) for creating carousels, among other possibilities.
- Add PDF file.
- Manage secondary administrators, with restricted rights, under the main administrator.

Explore the API menu to access public endpoints for external website integration.
